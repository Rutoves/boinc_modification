Steps to complete installation:

-  Change Apache configuration (as root):

   If you are using Apache 2.4, edit the /home/rutoves/projects/test_algo/test_algo.httpd.conf
   (see file for specific instructions).

   cat /home/rutoves/projects/test_algo/test_algo.httpd.conf >> /etc/apache/httpd.conf

   (path to httpd.conf varies; try /etc/httpd/ or /etc/apache2)

   Then restart the web server:

   /usr/sbin/apache2ctl restart
   (or /usr/sbin/apachectl restart)

-  Add to crontab (as root)

    crontab -e

    and add the line:

    0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * cd /home/rutoves/projects/test_algo ; /home/rutoves/projects/test_algo/bin/start --cron


-  In the project home directory (/home/rutoves/projects/test_algo) run

    bin/xadd

-  The project is configured with a test application.
   To install this application (recommended) run:
        cd /home/rutoves/projects/test_algo
